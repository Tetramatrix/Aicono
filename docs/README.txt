# 🚀 Aicono - AI intelligent desktop icon autopilot

🧠 Aicono organizes a cluttered Windows desktop automatically by grouping icons with AI and arranging them into a neat, overlap-free layout with a live visual preview. It runs portable with sane defaults out of the box, and features a full WYSIWYG canvas editor for visual fine-tuning.

### ⭐ Key features
- 🤖 Zero AI knowledge required: download, extract, run; default settings deliver instant grouping and layout on Windows 10/11 64‑bit.

- 🎛️ Full Model Manager: connect to multiple cloud and on-prem LLM backends including OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama, Lemonade, Llamacpp, and other compatible services. The model manager lists all available models and allows users to activate or deactivate models as needed for specific tasks.

- 🔗 Multi-Service AI Integration: supports seamless connection to both on-prem and cloud-based AI services:
  - 🏢 On-Prem Services: Ollama, Llamacpp, Lemonade, and other self-hosted LLM solutions
  - ☁️ Cloud Services: OpenAI, Mistral, and other cloud-based AI platforms
  - ⚙️ Flexible Configuration: easily switch between different AI backends based on your needs, privacy requirements, and performance considerations

- 🎨 Full WYSIWYG Canvas Editor: direct manipulation of workspace elements. Drag and drop icons between groups, rearrange groups, rename items, and adjust group boundaries with an intuitive visual interface.

- 👁️ WYSIWYG layout editor: select the desktop region, preview placement, and adjust grid size with a self‑explaining visual editor.

- 📐 Smart layout engine: place icons neatly without overlaps and respects a user‑defined working area.

- 📦 Portable by design: no installation, no registry writes, and no system files touched, keeping the footprint minimal.

- ✨ Visual fine-tuning: drag & drop icons between groups to reclassify them visually, resize and reposition groups directly on the canvas, and rename groups with real-time preview.

### 🚀 Quick start
- 📥 Download the portable archive, extract anywhere, and run Aicono.exe.

- ⚙️ Optional: open the Model Manager to configure LLM backends and use the visual editor to fine-tune your desktop layout.

Changelog: 


Version: 1.0.2
Headline: Major Update: Mindmap Mode, WYSIWYG Editor, Persistent Sessions & Website Redesign

Changelog:

New Features:

Mindmap Visualization: A new view mode that generates a mindmap-style diagram of your desktop hierarchy, helping users visualize icon relationships and group structures before applying changes.

Full WYSIWYG Canvas Editor: Completely transformed user experience. Users can now drag and drop icons between groups, create new groups, delete unwanted groups, and resize boundaries visually on an interactive canvas.

Multi-Service AI Integration: Added a comprehensive Model Manager that connects to both on-prem services (Ollama, LlamaCpp) and cloud providers (OpenAI, Mistral), allowing users to choose the best model for their privacy and performance needs.

Persistent Sessions: The application now remains open after the initial arrangement, allowing for immediate fine-tuning and adjustments without needing to restart the analysis process.

Improvements:

Website & Documentation Redesign: A completely overhauled website provides clearer onboarding, better documentation for model configuration, and a more modern user experience.

Enhanced Layout Engine: Improved grid algorithm prevents icon overlaps and strictly respects user-defined working areas.

Offline Capability: Includes pre-configured lightweight models for immediate offline use, with options to download larger, more capable models.

Portable Design: Maintained zero-installation footprint; no registry writes or system file modifications.

Fixes:

Resolved the issue where the application would close automatically after a single arrangement pass.

Addressed "hit-or-miss" categorization by adding manual override capabilities via the visual editor.
